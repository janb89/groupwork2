    "\n",
    "1. You need to analyse or build reporting on your organization's data that is only available via one or multiple APIs\n",
    "2. You want to enrich your organization's data with external data to improve decision making and drive business value\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, being able to connect to and query from APIs is an invaluable skill and will make you more flexible when it comes to working with different data sources. We know working with APIs can be overwhelming and in order to spare you unnecessary frustration, this notebook will provide you with a structured step-by-step approach to make working with APIs as easy and fun as possible.\n",
